Opening Output Files":"    Files in the 'Autoscored Output File(s)' column can be opened by double-clicking on their names in the column. \n(WARNING: if output files of the same name are created in the same location and one of the files in the output column is overwritten as a result, the result of double-clicking it is undefined. Take precautions to properly save all output files, renaming or moving if necessary)",

A horizontal line of asterisks will be placed between each created batch of output files to allow the user to determine which files belong to which sets \n(WARNING: the warning given in ii. applies here as well.)"
